# Email Spam Detection using SVM and NLTK

## Overview
This project implements an **Email Spam Detection** system using **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** and **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**. It classifies emails as spam or ham using text preprocessing techniques and machine learning.

## Features
- Text preprocessing with NLTK (stopword removal, stemming)
- TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction
- SVM classifier for email classification
- Dataset handling and evaluation metrics

## Installation
pip install -r requirements.txt
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Swifter (for optimized dataframe operations)

### Setup
Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Email-Spam-Detection-using-NLP.git
cd Email-Spam-Detection-using-NLP
